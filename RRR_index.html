                            <p class="story"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._S._Rajamouli">Rajamouli</a> came across reading stories about the lives of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alluri_Sitarama_Raju">Rama Raju</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komaram_Bheem">Bheem</a>, and connected the coincidences between them, imagining what 
                                would have happened had they been friends. Set in 1920, the plot explores the undocumented period in their lives when both the revolutionaries choose to go into oblivion before they began the fight for their country.</p>
